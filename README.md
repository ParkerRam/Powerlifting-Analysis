# Powerlifing Analysis
Data wrangling, EDA and model fitting of [OpenPowerlifting's Datset](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/). I took a look at the exponential growth of this niche sport as well as identified what body traits correlate with strength. Used non-parametric hypothesis test (Mann Whitney U) to test is there is a significant difference in strength among top level lifters in drug tested and non drug tested federations. Used linear regression with a polynomial basis to predict a lifter's bodyweight achieving a RMSE of 0.0202.

# What I learned
* Basic of matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
* Fitting regression models in practice
* Model fitting workflow in python
